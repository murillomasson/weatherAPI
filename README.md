# Open Weather Map API 
## MongoDB, FastAPI
FastAPI app that searches for latitude and longitude of a given city and, from this information, returns meteorological information and saves it in a given collection in MongoDB.

```

- Install all the requirements:

```
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
